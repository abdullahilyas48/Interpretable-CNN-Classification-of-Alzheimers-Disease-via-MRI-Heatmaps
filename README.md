## Overview

Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects millions worldwide. Early detection and accurate staging are crucial for effective treatment and patient care. This project leverages deep learning to classify MRI images into four Alzheimer's disease stages:

- **Non Demented**: Normal cognitive function
- **Very Mild Demented**: Early stage with minimal symptoms
- **Mild Demented**: Noticeable cognitive decline
- **Moderate Demented**: Significant impairment requiring assistance

## Key Features

- **Four-Class Alzheimer’s Classification**  
  Classifies MRI brain scans into four stages: Non Demented, Very Mild Demented, Mild Demented, and Moderate Demented.

- **CNN-Based Deep Learning Model**  
  Utilizes a ResNet50 backbone with transfer learning for robust feature extraction and high classification accuracy.

- **Two-Phase Training Strategy**  
  Implements frozen-backbone training followed by fine-tuning to improve generalization and performance.

- **Explainable AI with Grad-CAM**  
  Generates class-specific heatmaps highlighting brain regions most influential in the model’s predictions.

- **Integrated Gradients Interpretability**  
  Provides additional gradient-based attribution to support and validate Grad-CAM explanations.

- **High Performance Metrics**  
  Evaluates the model using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix across all classes.

- **Stability Analysis of Explanations**  
  Assesses robustness of Grad-CAM heatmaps using SSIM-based consistency evaluation under perturbations.

- **End-to-End MRI Pipeline**  
  Covers preprocessing, augmentation, training, evaluation, and interpretability within a single workflow.

- **Visualization & Analysis Tools**  
  Includes overlayed heatmaps, training logs, metric plots, and confusion matrix visualizations.

- **Research & Education Oriented**  
  Designed for academic use, reproducibility, and interpretability-focused deep learning research.
